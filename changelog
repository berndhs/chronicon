== version 0.1.2 adds:

- more timeline distplays, such as:
  - mentions
  - retweets
  - own updates
  - specified other users updates

- follow/unfollow

- some bug fixes

== version 0.1.3:

- add search option to timeline switch display
- need qjson library for search (no xml results available)
- libnotify usage is optional in "configure" script,
  use chronicon/options.pri to tell qmake about it

- twitpic integration:
  - user can select an image to upload, and type a comment
  - image + comment are sent to twitpic.com with oauth-echo
  - response from twitpic is used to make a status update 
    for twitter (or whatever service), user gets to edit the upate

== version 0.1.4:

- add links to see followers summary and followees summary.
- add convenient way to get back to user's home timeline
- add link to own posts list from headline
- suspend polling when viewing special timelines, like search results
- remove non-word characters from links for # and @
- provide a script to fix the build problem for qca-ossl with old versions of
  openssl (fix_whirlpool.sh). This probably turns off support for the
  whirlpool hash, so IF you use whirlpool hash, AND you use openssl-0.9.8m or
  earlier, AND you find something using whirlpool hash is not authenticated,
  this is why. You can then try steps including, but not limited to these:
   * use a combination of qca-ossl/openssl that doesn't have this build
     problem
   * get whoever uses whirlpool hash in their authentication scheme to use
     something else

- weridifies the ouath a little more, following the proposal of the twitter
  people to make things as obscure as possible
