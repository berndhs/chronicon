Chronicon is a twitter client using Qt and a QOAuth fork

Using OAuth
-----------

By default, chronicon is configured to so Basic Authentication login.
This works for Twitter and StatusNet servers.

To use the new and improved authentication for Twitter called OAuth,
change the configuration:

 - click on Start/Stop
   - click on Configure
   - open up the "network" section
   - edit the "login_type" entry to read "oauth", without the quotes.
   - Save

Link Shortening
---------------

Chronicon will automatically shorten links in your posts if you tell it
your bit.ly user name and key. You can do that in the configuration.


Requirements
------------

To build this, you need a few things:

- Qt 4.6 or later. Yes, Qt 4.5 won't work
- qca2-devel
- libnotify

To RUN this with OAuth, you also need:

- qca-ossl

  it will run with basic authorization without this library.
  It will *build* without this library as well, but if you try
  to use OAuth (web login), it will crash complaining about
  HMAC SHA1 not being supported. That is qca2 giving up.
