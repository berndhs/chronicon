Chronicon is a twitter client using Qt and a QOAuth fork

When building from source, the executable is in chronicon/chronicon.

Using OAuth
-----------

By default, chronicon is configured to so Basic Authentication login.
This works for Twitter and StatusNet servers.

To use the new and improved authentication for Twitter called OAuth,
change the configuration:

 - click on Start/Stop
   - click on Configure
   - open up the "network" section
   - edit the "login_type" entry to read "oauth", without the quotes.
   - Save

Link Shortening
---------------

Chronicon will automatically shorten links in your posts if you tell it
your bit.ly user name and key. You can do that in the configuration.


Requirements
------------

To BUILD this, you need a few things:

- Qt 4.6 or later. Yes, Qt 4.5 won't work
- qca2-devel
- libnotify [see "Build Options" below if you don't have it]
- qjson-devel

To RUN this with OAuth, you also need:

- qca-ossl

  it will run with basic authorization without this library.
  It will *build* without this library as well, but if you try
  to use OAuth (web login), it will crash complaining about
  HMAC SHA1 not being supported. That is qca2 giving up.

Of course on your linux distro, library names may be different. 

Build Options
-------------

There are a few optional ways to build Chronicon.

There is a "configure" script, which at present has these options:

  --help  show option list and do nothing

  --prefix=/where/you/want/it   this sets the destination directory of
                                where you want "make install" to copy the
                                executable. Defaults to /usr.

  --nonotify                    compile chronicon without libnotify.
                                When you do that, you don't get
                                popup notification.
