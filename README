Chronicon is a twitter client using Qt and a QOAuth fork

Requirements
------------

To build this, you need a few things:

- Qt 4.6 or later. Yes, Qt 4.5 won't work
- qca2-devel
- libnotify

To RUN this with OAuth, you also need:

- qca-ossl

  it will run with basic authorization without this library.
  It will *build* without this library as well, but if you try
  to use OAuth (web login), it will crash complaining about
  HMAC SHA1 not being supported. That is qca2 giving up.
